  story: `My journey into business analytics began with a simple fascination: how do numbers tell stories that can change the world? During my undergraduate studies in Business Administration, I discovered that behind every successful business decision lies a foundation of data waiting to be understood and leveraged.

My path has taken me from analyzing seller performance data at Amazon in Hyderabad, where I helped improve customer experiences for thousands of marketplace partners, to pursuing advanced analytics education at the University of Central Oklahoma. Along the way, I've had the privilege of working on projects that span from railway safety systems in Portugal to renewable energy policy in India.

What drives me is the belief that data analytics isn't just about numbersâ€”it's about creating meaningful impact. Whether I'm developing predictive maintenance models that could prevent railway accidents, analyzing Olympic Games data to uncover hidden patterns in sports history, or helping businesses optimize their operations, I see each project as an opportunity to make life better for real people.`,
